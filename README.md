# pygame-chess
A chess game using `python-chess` and `pygame`

Run
  `python3 game.py`
or if you have a chess engine at hand provide it as an commandline argument like
  `python3 game.py /usr/bin/stockfish`

You can play a move yourself by using the mouse, or press a key to let the engine play a move (if you provided one).
